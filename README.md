# Dynamic Routing with OSPF

Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is a widely used link-state routing protocol designed for Internet Protocol (IP) networks. It enables routers within an autonomous system to dynamically exchange routing information and determine the most efficient path for data packets. Unlike distance-vector protocols like RIP, which send entire routing tables periodically, OSPF uses link-state advertisements (LSAs) to share only updates about the status of directly connected links. These LSAs are flooded throughout the network, allowing each router to build a complete topological map of the network.

Using this map, OSPF applies Dijkstra’s Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm to calculate the best path to each destination and updates its routing table accordingly. OSPF supports hierarchical network design through the use of areas, with Area 0 (the backbone area) connecting all other areas. This structure enhances scalability and reduces routing overhead.

OSPF is classless (supports VLSM), converges quickly, and supports features like authentication, load balancing, and route summarization. It is an open standard, meaning it can be used across multiple vendors’ devices, making it popular in enterprise and service provider networks.
